# Polymarket Configuration (4 Wallets - One Per AI)
# You connected 4 METAMASK wallets to Polymarket

# ============================================================================
# WALLET ARCHITECTURE EXPLAINED (for MetaMask users):
# ============================================================================
# Each AI trader needs 3 pieces of information:
#
# 1. PRIVATE_KEY - Your MetaMask private key (export from MetaMask extension)
#    This key derives an EOA address (your actual MetaMask wallet address)
#
# 2. FUNDER - The EOA address derived from your private key
#    This is your MetaMask wallet address (e.g., 0x5628...bDB60)
#    Used for authentication and signing transactions
#
# 3. PROXY - The Polymarket proxy address (e.g., 0x31A1...4791)
#    This is shown under your profile picture on Polymarket.com
#    This is where your USDC should be deposited for trading
#    This is where trades execute (NOT your MetaMask address!)
#
# EXAMPLE FLOW:
# Private Key → Derives EOA (MetaMask address) → Creates Proxy (Polymarket trading address)
# 0x8297...d37f → 0x5628...bDB60 → 0x31A1...4791
#
# WHERE TO FIND THESE VALUES:
# - Private Key: MetaMask → Account Details → Export Private Key
# - Funder (EOA): Your MetaMask wallet address (also shown in MetaMask)
# - Proxy: Polymarket.com → Click your profile → Address shown under picture
#
# WHERE TO SEND USDC:
# Send USDC to the PROXY address (not your MetaMask address!)

# IMPORTANT SETUP STEPS:
# 1. Connect 4 MetaMask wallets to Polymarket.com (one for each AI)
# 2. Fund each PROXY wallet with $150+ USDC on Polygon (chain ID 137)
# 3. USDC must be sent to PROXY addresses (not MetaMask addresses!)
# 4. Approve USDC spending on Polymarket (may be automatic via MetaMask)
# 5. Set private keys, funder (EOA), and proxy addresses in this file
# 6. Deploy and run!
